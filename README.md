# A-vs-Dijkstra-comparative-analysis-
Finding the shortest path in direction effective is essential. To solve this shortest path
problem, we usually using Dijkstra or A* algorithm. These two algorithms are often used
in routing or road networks. This paperâ€™s objective is to compare those two algorithms
in solving this shortest path problem. In this research, Dijkstra and A* almost have the
same performance when using it to solve town or regional scale maps, but A* is better
when using it to solve a large scale map.
